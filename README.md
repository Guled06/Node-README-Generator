# Node README Generator

This README Generator Project was designed to allow the user to generate a good readme.md document. 

This command-line application accepts user input when the user is prompted for information about his application. The user of this application will be able to generate a high-quality README.md file with the title of his/her project, sections, description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contribution, Tests and Questions displayed in the README.md file once it is generated. 


Once the user enters his/her project title, the title will be displayed in the README.md file. The same goes for the rest of the prompts the user will answer. The answers the user gives will be documented in the README.md file. In this application, the user will also be able to provide a link to his/her Github profile, LinkedIn, email and even include a video tutorial if they wanted to.
